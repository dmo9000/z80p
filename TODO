* update cpstest benchmark to measure non-scrolled vs scrolled performance
* hardcode bmf font
* make cvi work, improve performance! 
* network module
* graphics module
* improve terminal scroll speed (scroll optimization? dirty rectangles?)

* ATTRIB_HALFINTENSITY output is probably not correct, cross reference with DOS+ANSI.SYS
* only execute x cycles per second (fix bogomips)
* various missing ANSI code support in libansicanvas (much done; need to test WordStar4)
* batch screen updates (ie. don't update display after every character is output)
* hardware clock interrupt (partially done; needs more testing)
* build on Windows
* sound module
